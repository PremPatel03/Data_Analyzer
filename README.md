Description:

This user interface was created to run a variety of functions that are able to sort, 
add/remove, and search books in a given csv file. When running the interface, the "get_books" 
commands will return the books and information within the criteria that is searched. The 
add/remove commands returns a new dictionary with the added/removed books included. The "sort_books" 
commands will return a book list depending on whichever subcommand is given.
